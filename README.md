# HeatMap

Assignment for the course of parallel computing @University of Minho. This was an optional course.
This simple project demonstrates a heat map dispersion algorithm using OpenMP, calculated both on sequential and parallel versions. For the sequencial we used a i7 quad-core processor. Parallel tested on a cluster with 24 cores (xeon phi).
